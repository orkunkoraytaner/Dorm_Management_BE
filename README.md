# Dormitory Management System API

This is a comprehensive RESTful API for managing a university dormitory, built with Spring Boot. It provides a backend foundation for handling students, rooms, staff, payments, and maintenance requests.

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Student Management**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student records.
  * **Room Management**: Manage dormitory rooms, including capacity and floor details.
  * **Staff Management**: Handle records for dormitory personal.
  * **Role-Based System**: Assign roles to both students and staff.
  * **Payment Tracking**: Log and manage payments for each student.
  * **Maintenance Ticketing**: Create and track maintenance requests for rooms.
  * **Student Statistics**: Endpoints to get analytics, like student counts by department and groupings by floor.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  * **Framework**: Spring Boot 3.5.3
  * **Language**: Java 17
  * **Database**: Spring Data JPA with Hibernate. Configured for MySQL.
  * **API Documentation**: Springdoc OpenAPI (Swagger UI)
  * **Build Tool**: Maven

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * **Java JDK 17** or higher installed.
  * **Apache Maven** installed.
  * **MySQL Server** running on your local machine.

### 1\. Database Setup

1.  Make sure your MySQL server is running.
2.  Create a new database named `dormdb`. You can do this with the following SQL command:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE dormdb;
    ```

### 2\. Configure the Application

1.  Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
2.  Update the database username and password to match your local MySQL setup:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.username=YOUR_MYSQL_USERNAME
    spring.datasource.password=YOUR_MYSQL_PASSWORD
    ```

### 3\. Build and Run the Application

1.  Open a terminal in the root directory of the project (`Dorm_Management_BE`).
2.  Build the project using Maven. This will download all the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```
3.  Once the build is successful, run the application:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
4.  The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

## üìñ API Documentation (Swagger)

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) to view and test all the available endpoints.

  * **Swagger UI URL**: [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)

## üîÄ API Endpoints

Here is a summary of the main API endpoints available in the application.

#### Student Management

  * `POST /students`: Create a new student.
  * `GET /students`: Get a list of all students.
  * `GET /students/{id}`: Get a specific student by their ID.
  * `PUT /students/{id}`: Update a student's details.
  * `DELETE /students/{id}`: Delete a student.

#### Student Statistics

  * `GET /students/statistics/by-department`: Get a count of students in each department.
  * `GET /students/statistics/by-floor`: Get lists of students grouped by their floor number.

#### Room Management

  * `POST /rooms`: Create a new room.
  * `GET /rooms`: Get a list of all rooms.
  * `GET /rooms/{id}`: Get a specific room by its ID.

#### Payment Management

  * `POST /students/{studentId}/payments`: Add a payment for a specific student.
  * `GET /students/{studentId}/payments`: Get the payment history for a specific student.
  * `DELETE /students/{studentId}/payments/{paymentId}`: Delete a specific payment.

#### Maintenance Ticket Management

  * `POST /rooms/{roomId}/tickets`: Create a new maintenance ticket for a room.
  * `GET /rooms/{roomId}/tickets`: Get all tickets for a specific room.
  * `PUT /rooms/{roomId}/tickets/{ticketId}/status`: Update the status of a ticket.
  * `DELETE /rooms/{roomId}/tickets/{ticketId}`: Delete a ticket.

*(Note: Endpoints for `Personal` and `Roles` are also available and follow a similar CRUD pattern.)*

## üîÆ Future Improvements

This project provides a solid foundation. The next steps to turn this into a production-ready application would be to implement:

1.  **Global Exception Handling**: To provide clear error messages for invalid requests.
2.  **Input Validation**: To ensure the data sent to the API is correct and complete.
3.  **Security**: To protect the API with authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization.
4.  **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: To separate the internal data model from the API layer.
5.  **Unit and Integration Testing**: To ensure the code is reliable and bug-free.
